## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Run website locally**

    Use the default npm script to spin up a local development server running Gatsby and serving all generated static HTML pages under localhost:8000.

    ```shell
    # run local development server
    npm start
    ```

2.  **Build website for production.**

    Building for production creates all the static artifacts which can then be deployed to a server. Use the build script for this task.

    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```
